Core goals
----------

Massively multiplayer
Simple to play
Get people talking/engaged

20x20 grid
Game works best when played between a group of friends (~17 people)
Players start as a tank on a random/chosen tile
Players have three hearts
Players are given an action point every day (hour? 12 hours?)
Players may choose to spend one or more action points at any time
One action point may be used to either move one square (8adj) or shoot once
Players have a default range of 2 adjacent tiles
Players may invest action points to increase their range
Shooting another player removes one heart from that player
Players may choose to shoot their action point to another player
Lose all three of your hearts and you die and are added to The Jury
Every player on The Jury votes once a day for a player they want to help
Any player that gets at least 3 votes from The Jury gets an extra action point that day
Last player standing wins

Suggested modifications in conference talk:
Randomness (different hit probabilities at certain ranges, etc)
Shooting a player X number of action points grants you immunity to that person for X number of turns
Have one person spawn as a secret enemy to everyone else


Modifications to original idea
------------------------------

Light cyberpunk theme 
	Obviously the game is text based so it's not overtly cyberpunk, but maybe incorporate some light worldbuilding in the characters/environment/themes/gameplay
	Name ideas: Replicant, Off-world, Calantha, Nexus-8, Baseline, 6.10.21, KD6-3.7, Tannh√§user Gate
	"I saw the truth on the plains of Calantha"
ASCII text-based grid game
Replace tanks with classes (roguelike)
Classes could have special abilities/effects
Classes are represented by an ASCII symbol
Players can choose a color for their character
Background color of player tile represents health
Respawning (leaving the Jury and re-entering the game)
Closed entry? (the person who creates a match can control who joins via invite links)
Time-limited entry? (game is open for new players to join for a period of time)
Login functionality (username/password)
Shooting an action point to another player consumes an action point (so you require at least 2 action points to shoot someone an action point, one to be shot and one to be consumed)
Terrain/obstacles/items/powerups
NPCs?
Simultaneous action (everyone submits their move in advance and then all moves are executed at one time)
Display time until next turn in UI
Use blockchain?
	Create blocks where transactions are player moves
	A single worldwide map could then be utilized, with each player generating a local view of it
	Built-in resistance against cheating

Server only keeps track of player info (position, state, stats, resources) and game state 
Game occurs asynchronously so server must track which players may make moves
